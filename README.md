Triangle Ember - 2/15/2017

In this talk, we’ll discuss the basics of linting and dig into the latest linter, eslint.  I’ll cover configuration and some of the tooling ecosystem from cli and auto-fix to IDE integration.  Finally, we’ll bring it home with how eslint can be integrated into your Ember project (including testing).
